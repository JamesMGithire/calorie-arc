# Project's Title - Calorie Arc
Calorie Arc is a calories tracker app that allows its users to plan their meals and keep track of their calorie intake.

# Project Description
Calorie Arc helps people live healthier lives by taking control of what they eat. It gives the users a chance to choose through an array of meal plans and calculates the calories in every meal. Whether you want to gain, lose or maintain your weight, Calorie Arc is the app for you.

# Technologies
Being a collaborative project, Calorie Arc used different technologies to create a functional app, give the users a unique and aestheticlly pleasing experience and make integration of the code easier. Among the technologies used was ReactJs for event handling and Ruby for the back end.
# Features
User-friendly and well-designed UI
Functionality resolution

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
